Student-Faculty Research Project: 3D Printed Gallery of Algebraic Surfaces

•	Work with Dr.Dani Brake and another student (David Bachmeier) on how to compute 3D mathematical models using numerical algebraic software Bertini_real (with Matlab)

•	Learn how to modify, repair, print 3D models using Blender, 3D Builder and Simplify3D

•	Schedule math surface decomposition jobs on Blugold Supercomputing Cluster using PuTTY

The software can be found on: https://github.com/ofloveandhate/bertini_real
